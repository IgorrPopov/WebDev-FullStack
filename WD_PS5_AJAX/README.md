- require PHP version 7.2.9
- tested on XAMPP
- the program itself creates a folder and database files (class JsonFileChecker)
- if your system is unable to create files during program execution, 
create manually two Json files at 'app/database/' auth_database.json and chat_database.json,
in the files you need to write an empty array ({})
